const TDS = `The air burned with sand and incense.  Dhara shoved through the crowd, ignoring the shouts and curses that followed her.  Vantera’s streets were always crowded, but today they felt like a wall closing in around her.  The scent  of spice and sweat hung thick in the air.  Dhara ducked to the side nimbly avoiding the half hearted attempt of someone to grab her.  She was probably already too late, she had been across the city when the information reached her.  
No, not again.  She told herself, pushing through a robed group of Durdhara priests.  This time she would finally stop that monster once and for all.
	Her lungs burned as she drew in great dry breaths of the hot air.  When she reached the district where the assassination would take place, she slowed until she came to a stop just before the district’s plaza, a massive throng of people mingling before her. 
	If she wasn’t too late, the order should have someone placed on a nearby roof to make sure their target couldn’t get away.  Raising her head she scanned the rooftops around the plaza.  After an agonizingly long moment, her eyes landed on who she was looking for.  Standing on the roof to her left, was a man dressed all in black, a dull glint from his painted breastplate was just visible.
	Dhara ducked to the side as the man turned in her direction.  Her face was unfortunately well known to the order, and if they spotted her now there was no chance she would make it in time.  Pulling her green scarf over her head and up to cover her mouth, she gracefully slipped through the crowd until she reached the building the sentry was on.  
	Placing her back against the wall of the structure, worn smooth through countless sandstorms and passersby, Dhara quickly moved around the side of the building.  Rounding the corner into the alley, she dashed towards the flight of stairs that provided access to the roof where the sentry was.  
	Reaching the roof a few heartbeats later, she ran straight for the sentry.  Hearing her coming, the sentry spun around, hand dropping to his sword hilt, but before he could draw his weapon, Dhara called on the power of her manipulation.
	Immediately the noise from the street below her vanished as time slowed to a crawl all around her as the color drained away leaving the world cold and grey.  The sentry’s black robe hung suspended in the air from his sudden turn, a bird behind him hung suspended in the air wings slowly untucking from its side.  She felt the familiar rush of power and excitement, she felt it every time she used her power.
	She closed the distance to the guard quickly, using her momentum to bring her leg up and aim a kick right for the sentry’s ribs.  The moment before her boot connected, she stopped her manipulation.  The world slammed back into motion in a roar of voices and a rush of color.  The chaos of a hundred conversations drowned out the sentry’s cry of surprise as the power of Dhara’s kick sent him tumbling off the roof.
	Shouts of alarm mixed with curses as the sound of breaking wood cut through the sound of conversation.  Not bothering to look down, Dhara stepped up to the edge of the roof and scanned the plaza before her.  She briefly considered slowing time again, but quickly discarded the idea as it would leave her too weak to stop what was about to happen.
Dozens of brightly colored fabrics covered the stalls that bought and traded almost anything in a mad frenzy.  The conflicting scents and sounds mixed together until it was nearly impossible to tell them apart.  Somewhere in the distance a deep bell rang through the city cutting through all conversations.  It was the warning bell on the wall, a storm was coming.
Her pulse matched the tolling of the distant bell as if it mocked her, counting every time she had been too late.  As merchants and shoppers alike started making preparations for the oncoming storm, Dhara finally saw what she was looking for.  A beam of white light shot into the sky, despite the brightly shining sun overhead she could see the light clearly.  
Before the light had fully faded, Dhara was already moving.  Jumping off the roof, she landed lightly on a stack of crates before dropping down to the chaotic street as people rushed to find shelter from the storm.  Landing in a run, Dhara charged towards where she had seen the light.  
I’m not going to be too late this time.  She told herself as she ran, shoving and pushing her way forward.
As she neared the spot where she had seen the ray of light, the stall just before her exploded in red fire.  Screams shattered the air as people ran from the fire, the tide of the crowd working against Dhara as she fought to reach it.
Finally breaking free from the mob, she was just in time to watch a young man stumble out of the wreckage of the burning stall.  He barely made it half a dozen paces before a bolt of fire shot from the burning remains of the stall catching him in the back.  
Letting out a cry of pain, the man collapsed on the ground as a figure emerged from the burning stall.  Bare arms covered in fire, he held a sword to the side as he casually made his way towards the young man who was struggling to rise.
“Fashk,” Dhara swore, whipping her daggers out of her belt as she charged forward.
	I’m not going to make it in time.  She realized with horror as the flamer planted his boot on the young man’s back forcing him down to the ground.
	With a practiced flick of the wrist, Dhara sent one of her daggers spinning towards the flamer.  The dagger slammed into his shoulder as he raised his sword.  Crying out in pain, the man stumbled backwards dropping his sword as the flames covering his body nearly tied out.  Crimson blood ran down his shoulder as he looked down at the weapon in his shoulder.
	As Dhara charged towards the man, she drew another dagger from her belt almost automatically, as the man turned his fiery gaze towards her.  Before she even made it halfway there, a sudden force slammed into her with terrible power.   The air was forced from her lungs as she felt her feet leave the ground.  She flew several feet before slamming painfully into a large wooden post that supported a large awning.
	Pinned by the unseen power, Dhara could barely move, let alone breath as the force crushed her.  With tremendous effort she turned her head back towards the smoldering stall.  The air fell still as heat shimmered across the wreckage, then she saw him.  Tarak, the Duskra, stepping through the smoke as if the fire parted for him.  Haat shimmered around him like a halo of ash.  Anger, hot and furious exploded in her chest as she watched him slowly walk towards her.  
He was a large man, taller than the average Vanteran, with shoulders twice the width of a normal man.  His head and squared jaw were both clean shaven.  The majority of his bulky frame was hidden by layers of black and deep maroon robes.
	“I was wondering when you’d come.”  Tarak said, stopping in front of her.  “You always arrive just after the light fades.”
	Dhara let out a cry of rage.  “You krathing monster.”  Dhara struggled furiously against the power holding her to the wall as she stared into Tarak’s dark merciless eyes.
	“I take no joy in this.  But I do it for the good of all, even you.  And despite having all the time in the world, you still can’t stop the inevitable.”  Tarak said, turning away from her.
	Behind him, the young man was just struggling to his feet, the other assassin had sunk to his knees, one hand pressed to his shoulder with dark red blood seeping through his fingers as he tried to staunch the bleeding, his flames completely out.
	The young man finally gained his footing.  Shooting a backwards glance at Tarak, he ran away. Tarak didn’t give chase, instead he reached into the folds of his dark robe and pulled out his Duskfang.  The black bladed dagger was longer than Dhara’s forearm with a slight curve at the tip. Sunlight glinted off of the delicate golden veins that were encased in the blackness as Tarak raised the weapon.
	“No!”  Dhara screamed, as she watched helplessly as the young man rose into the air and sailed backwards straight towards Tarak’s outstretched dagger.
	Time buckled under her desperation as this one terrible moment stretched out.  Color faded from the world as Dhara struggled fruitlessly against Tarak’s power that pinned her to the post.  She watched helplessly as the man was slowly pulled onto Tarak’s blade, piercing his heart with a flash of black energy.  He didn’t scream.  None of them ever did.
	Time returned to normal in a rush of sounds, scents and colors.  Tarak pulled his bloodied dagger free, dropping the young man’s body to the dusty cobblestones.  The body hit the cobblestone with a sound that hollowed the air.
	“I return your light to you, Antaka.”  Tarak said solemnly, looking down at the body at his feet and the spreading pool of blood.
	“No!”  Dhara screamed again, feeling hot tears on her face.  
	She had failed again.  Why can’t I ever save them?  She thought furiously.  
	Slowly Tarak turned towards her, his face solemn.  “I am sorry, but it had to be done.  Every light must fade before it wakes the shadow.”
	Dhara opened her mouth to say something but before she could she felt the pressure pinning her to the post suddenly increase forcing the air out of her lungs.  Dhara gasped, unable to get any air as the pressure forced down on her entire body.  Her body screamed in pain as the world started to grow dark.
	“Maybe one day you will understand.”  She heard Tarak say before everything faded to black.
	Dhara woke with great gasping breaths, breathing in a large amount of sand as she did so.  Her head throbbed painfully as she coughed the dust out.  She was laying facedown on something hard and grainy.  Slowly pushing herself up, a large amount of dust fell from her hair landing on the cobblestones before her.  
	Her body ached, as she took several painful breaths, pain shooting through her chest with each one.  I probably have a few broken ribs.  She thought dully, leaning her back against the pole Tarak had pinned her against.  
	Based on the thick coating of sand over everything around her, she had been unconscious for the entire storm.  Even though the storm had passed, the air still smelled of ash and dust.  There was only one other person in the plaza, and he was dead.  Sand covered the young man’s body, sticking to the blood that ran down his side and pooled on the ground.  
	Dhara felt a wave of sadness wash over her.  He was the twelfth one she had tried to save.  
They were all dead now.

const LOTFK = `“And she’s sold to the man up front!” The haunting voice boomed. “Next up is a strong young lad from the coast...”
	Images flashed through Saul’s mind as the shouted price got higher and higher.  The sun beat down on him, the sweat trickling down the side of his face as he listened to the people shouting.  Finally, the room fell silent as the call for the last bids was issued.
	“Sold!”  The man declared, smashing down his hammer.
Saul shot up in his cot, the dagger he slept with held tightly in his hand, the shouting voices and thud of the hammer still ringing in his ears.  Looking around his dark tent, he blinked away the sweat in his eyes as he took several deep breaths trying to calm his pounding heart.  
After a few minutes of deep breathing, Saul finally lowered the knife and laid back down.  The echoes of the haunting images and sounds still lingered in his head after all these years.  There was only one thing that could stop them, and even that was killing him slowly.  He was just starting to drift off to sleep again when he heard the horns blowing in the distance.
Suddenly the flap to his tent was thrown open violently.  Shooting back up, dagger back in his hand, Saul turned towards the opening to see a young winded soldier, his helmet was too large and slightly askew and his sword pulled his belt down well past his hip and Saul seriously doubted whether the young man could shoot the gun which was holstered in his other side.  The messenger was about to say something when he spotted the dagger in Saul’s hand, his eyes growing wide as his face paled.
“What’s happening?”  Saul demanded, not lowering the dagger.
	“We are under attack,” The young man said, finally getting a grip.  “The Dathraki are being called to defend the wall.”  He finished straightening slightly as he spoke.
	Saul was already moving before the messenger had finished speaking.  Throwing back his covers, Saul moved across his small tent, kicking several beer bottles out of the way in the process.  The messenger left as Saul quickly pulled on a shirt and chestplate, followed by his boots and belt.  Like all Dathraki, Saul wore little armor, not wanting to be weighed down like the other soldiers in the army.  Sheathing his knife at the back of his belt and holstering his gun on his leg, Salu grabbed a quiver of arrows and his bow before charging out of the tent into the chaotic camp.
	The camp was a city of tents built on wooden pallets and crudely constructed barracks, with the command buildings at the center.  Over the years Saul had been there he had seen a transformation in the camp, from a temporary holding point to a long term command center for the war at the Black Caves.
	Saul took off running through the chaos headed towards the wall as men prepared for battle all around him.  Men shouted as they scrambled to get ready, losing valuable time as they fumbled with buckles and straps.  Saul had been too slow in response to an attack only once, and he vowed he would always be prepared from then on.  Spotting a few other Dathraki through the mess of soldiers, Saul made his way over to them.  
The Dathraki were a small group of highly trained soldiers, who used bows for close quarters combat.  Made from a rare metal that was nearly indestructible and incredibly lightweight, the Dathraki bows were just as deadly as their wielders up close. They nodded at him as he fell into rank beside his combat partner with several others falling in soon after him as they made their way to the wall.
	Twenty feet high the wall was made from a rock, a concrete mixture that was cheap, easily reparable and strong. It was the same material they used to make the barracks and some of the command buildings, though those were usually nicer quality.  
	There were dozens of outposts around the Black Caves, keeping the underlings from reaching the main cities of Reignum, and Saul had been to nearly twenty during his time in the army.  As they approached the wall, Saul could tell immediately that he hadn’t seen an attack against a camp this strong in some time.
	The air rang with gunfire as soldiers on the wall open fired on the approaching enemy force.  Black underling arrows returned fire, some flying over the wall, others hitting stone or flesh.  Suddenly with an impact that shook the ground, something slammed into the wall directly ahead of Saul.  Shouts came from the wall soldiers as they focused their fire on whatever had slammed into the wall.
	“Spread out.”  Koran called.
	Moving with practiced movements the Dathraki split ranks spreading out before the wall in groups of two.  

	Suddenly with a force that shook the ground, something hit the wall.  Shouts came from the top of the wall as the soldiers tried to stop whatever was hitting the wall with their crossbows and guns.  Suddenly the wall exploded outwards, sending chunks of dirt and rock flying everywhere.  Having turned away as the wall exploded Saul turned back to see some sort of beast standing in the newly made gaping hole.  It had short powerful legs corded with thick muscle.  Grey spikes ran along its long tan back, its head which was built like a boulder had two small eyes a small mouth and a large horn.
	Underlings charged after the beast as it leapt forward through the opening, scattering soldiers left and right as the crack of gunshots and the ring of steel filled the air.  Saul turned to Rex, his combat partner, and without a word they charged into the battle.  Underlings were filthy dark creatures that lived deep underground and sought to destroy all those living above them, so naturally they had to be stopped.
	Drawing two quivers from his quiver he quickly fired them into the fray with deadly precision, dropping the nearest two monsters with cries of pain.  The familiar drum of bows being shot filled Saul’s ears as arrows flew past him into the hoard.  Drawing two more arrows firing one of them he hit an underling who was holding a stolen rifle in between the shoulders.  He was about to fire his second arrow, when a shout from Rex made him duck.  He heard the rush of wind as a blade sliced over his head.  Kicking back, he felt his foot connect with something solid.  Standing up and spinning around, he found himself face to face with an Underling.
	It’s black scaly face was screwed up as he swung his blade over his head.  Grabbing both ends of his bow, Saul raised it up just in time to block the attack, the force of the blow jarring his arms slightly.  The underling looked confused that he didn’t chop Saul’s bow clean in half.  Not giving him any time to recover, Saul kicked him in the chest causing him to stumble backwards before shooting him in the chest with the arrow he still held in his hand, dropping him dead.
	Looking around he saw several Underlings charging towards Rex, who was busy with several other monsters.  Judging he didn’t have enough time to get them all with his bow in time he drew the gun from his hip and quickly squeezed off several shots, dropping a monster with each shot fired.  He met eyes with Rex who nodded that he was fine, the stupid looking helmet framing his elvish features.  Saul nodded back before turning back to the battle.  The rest of the infantry had joined the battle now and were driving the Underlings back towards the gap in the wall.
	Quickly calculating how many arrows he had left, Saul watched the battle unfold in front of him.  Rex ran over to him and for a moment they surveyed the battle for a few moments, deciding where they were most needed.  After a few moments Saul realized that the Underling force wasn’t big enough to take the outpost, but they were still doing plenty of damage.
	Rex charged into the chaos first, Saul close behind, shooting arrows as they ran dropping a monster with each arrow fired.  The ring of steel and bang of gunfire nearly drowned out the screaming and yelling.  The smells of battle, dirt, sweat, gunpowder and blood filled the air as soldiers continued to fall on both sides as the battle drew on.  Slowly but surely pushing the Underlings back through the wall.  
	Dropping another Underling from point blank range with an arrow, Saul turned as the ground began to rumble.  Behind him charging straight for him was the beast that had broken the hole in the wall.
	“See any weak points on that thing?”  Rex asked, coming up besides Saul. 
	“Two.”  Saul replied.  “They are quite small though.”
	“I got left if you get right.”
	Saul shrugged as he pulled the last arrow from his quiver.  “Worth a shot.”  He replied.
	“It’s getting close.”  Rex noted, drawing an arrow of his own.
	“On three.”  Saul replied as he notched his arrow, eyes fixed on the charging beast.  “One…two…three!”
	As he said three their two arrows sped towards the charging beast inches apart from each other.  Not waiting to see if his arrow found it’s mark, Saul dove to the side to avoid being trampled by the monster.  He hit the dirt and rolled several feet, coming up on his feet dagger in hand.  Moments later there was a heavy crash that shook the ground silencing the field of battle for a moment. Turning Sail saw the lifeless beast laying in the dirt.  With an awful cry of horror, the Underlings retreated back through the wall.
	“I guess the eyes weren’t too small.” Rex said, walking over.
	Saul grunted in response as he watched the monsters flee.
	“I need a drink.”  Saul declared, turning and heading back towards camp.
< < < < < ~~~ > > > > >
Charity barely dared to breath as she stood with her back towards the large oak tree.  After waiting for several minutes, she slowly peered around her hiding place.  All she could see was the shrubbery of the forest.  Suddenly seeing movement out of the corner of her eye, she quickly pulled back into cover.
	Then, slowly crouching down she started walking bent over through the woods.  Heart racing she continued to go from tree to tree, pausing each time she found new shelter.  Suddenly as she was halfway to a large rock, a branch snapped somewhere behind her.  Heart beating faster she dashed to take cover behind the rock.  Breathing heavily, she could feel the sweat start to trickle down her face as she put her back against the stone.  She nearly jumped out of her skin as someone tapped her on the shoulder.  
Turning around she found her younger brother smirking at her.  Charity scowled at him, which only made his grin wider.  He was thirteen, two years younger than she was.  His hair was blue and an unruly mess and his eyes yellow.  They both had slim elven builds with golden tan elvish skin and she was taller than he was, a fact which she was quite happy with.
“Have you found Hope yet?”  She asked, somewhat irritated he had been able to scare her so badly.
Courage shook his head still grinning broadly.
Not yet. He signed with his hands, using elvish sign language, or ESL.
Courage had been born mute, though that didn’t stop him from being head of his class at school and learning how to communicate in more than one form of sign language.  Even though he couldn’t talk, Charity hadn’t ever found him to be quiet, he made noises in plenty of other ways.
“Well, then lets find her.”  Charity exclaimed.
First one to find her winds. He signed before dashing off into the trees.
Charity rolled her eyes as she started in the other direction in search for their little sister.  Charity enjoyed the time she spent with her siblings, even if she wasn’t the best at the games they played.  Currently they were playing hide and go seek in the woods behind their house.  The trees were old and tall covering the forest floor almost entirely in their fallen leaves.	
As she trudged through the trees her mind thought back to the math class and test from earlier that day.  She had thought she had done well, but she wasn’t sure, math had never been her strong subject.  She tried hard in all of her classes, but there was always something about math that she had a hard time understanding.
After nearly twenty minutes of searching, she shouted in surprise as a hand shot out from behind a bush and grabbed her arm.  Turning she slugged Courage in the shoulder making him wince slightly.
Ow, what was that for? He asked before rubbing his shoulder.
“You know what for, you little stinker.”  Charity replied coldly, she hated being scared.
I don’t think she’s here.  Courage signed.
“I think your right.”  Charity replied.  “She might have gone back to the house for a snack or something.”
Courage nodded.  Should we check? He asked, licking his lips.
“For Hope or for a snack?”  
Both.
“Well I was thinking we would just wait here.” Charity said sarcastically. 
Courage gave her a flat look before mouthing wow.  Charity winked at him before heading off towards the house.  She could hear the crunch of the leaves behind her as Courage followed after her. 
Before long their house came into sight.  With two stories and made of red brick, it was surrounded by more trees.  Their backyard was a rectangular patch of shortly cut grass, with a sand box in one corner and a swing set on the other side.  
Laying in the middle of the yard with her arms outstretched and staring up at the blue sky was hope.  Her golden yellow hair was sprawled out above her head on the grass.  Her eyes were closed and she had a pleasant smile on her face as the sun bathed her with warmth and light.  
“What are you doing?  You’re supposed to be hiding silly girl.”  Charity said, standing over her.
“I am hiding.”  She replied calmly, still not opening her eyes.
Charity looked up at Courage who shrugged.
“But you’re not hiding.”  Charity said, slightly confused.
“Yes, I am.  I’m hiding in plain sight.”  She replied, trying not to laugh.  “Like a ninja.”
Is that how that works?  Courage asked.
This time it was Charity’s turn to shrug.
“Why didn’t you hide, hide?”  She asked, still confused.
“Why would I if this worked?” Hope countered.
She has a point.  Courage signed.
Charity shrugged again and joined her sister in the grass.
“It’s ok.”  Hope said, patting Charity’s arm.  “Not everyone can be as smart as me.”
Charity could all but hear Courage’s laughter.  Closing her eyes she chose to ignore her sister’s remark, she was only five after all.  She heard Courage go inside the house for his snack, returning a minute later munching on something.  Charity couldn’t help but smile as the sun bathed her face in warmth.  Hearing movement beside her, she cracked open one eye and looked over at Hope to find that she wasn’t there.  Opening both her eyes all the way she sat up and looked around to find that both of her siblings were gone.  She had become the seeker now.  They continued to play hide and seek until their Mom called them in for dinner as the sun started to set.
She was standing in the sliding door that led into the house, her pink hair which matched Charity’s was pulled back into a pony tail, her apron covered in flour.
	“Wash up then join us at the table for dinner.”  She called, as the kids entered the backyard.
	After washing up they did as their Mom asked and joined their parents at the dinner table.  Their Dad, who was already sitting at the table, had hair that matched Courage’s, though his was slightly more tame.  Charity gave him a quick hug before sitting down to a meal of homemade biscuits and beef soup.  As they ate they each talked about their day, Hope going into heavy detail about how she became a ninja and outsmarted her older siblings.
	After dinner it was time to do homework as their parents talked and cleaned up in the kitchen.  They were conversing in old elvish, which meant they didn’t want the kids to hear what they were saying.  While she could only catch a word every now and then, Charity could tell they were stressed about something.
	“Time to get ready for bed.”  Dad declared, coming out of the kitchen just as Charity was finishing up.
	“Then story?”  Hope asked, looking up from her dolls she was playing with.
	“If you get ready fast enough, like a ninja.”  He replied.
	Hope shot off up the stairs in a flash, Courage and Charity close behind her.  Charity always loved her Dad’s stories.  Once she had gotten changed into her pajamas and brushed her teeth, her siblings gathered in her room to await their Dad.  They didn’t wait ling for him to arrive, whistling one of his favorite songs.
	“What story do you want to hear tonight?”  He asked, as he walked into the room rubbing his hands together.
	The Falling Knights.  Courage signed immediately.
	“The Falling Knights?”  Dad repeated, speaking and signing it at the same time for extra emphasis.
	Hope and Charity nodded.
	“Oh ok.”  He sighed, sitting down in Charity’s desk chair.  “Once upon a time a knight, Sir Thomas, was walking along a path in the dark forest, when his foot caught a root and he fell.  The end.”  He grinned broadly at his children.
	“Dad, that’s not funny.”  Hope complained, not even smiling at their Dad’s joke.
	Dad chuckled at his own joke.  “Ok, ok.  Long ago in a small village a monster was appearing every night and attacking the villagers.  Blacker than night and fouler than death, the villagers tried everything and could not stop the monster they named the Nightmare.  After trying for days and days, they could not stop it or kill it.  One night it returned with a vengeance and would have killed the entire village, if it hadn’t been for the Knights.  They fell from the sky in a blaze of glory, their armor and weapons ablaze with the fire that proved the Nightmare’s demise, saving the village.”
	“Hooray!”  Hope exclaimed, clapping her hands and yawning.
	Charity smiled, she knew there was a lot more to the story, and not all of it was as nice as Dad had said, she knew he probably held back the more terrifying details of the Nightmares for Hope’s sake.
	“Alright, bedtime.”  Dad declared, standing up.
	Courage and Hope said goodnight and left as Dad said goodnight to Charity.  Kissing her on her forehead, Dad turned to leave flicking off the light switch as he was leaving.
	“Dad?”  Charity called.
	“Hmm?”
	“Are the Falling Knights and Nightmares real?”
	Her dad thought for a moment before replying.  “Yes they are.  But after killing all the Nightmares the Knights faded into legend.”
	“How come?”
	“They weren’t needed anymore.”
	“What if the Nightmares.”  Charity asked, sitting up.
	“Then the Knights will return.”  He declared, walking back over to her bed.  “Light will always come to dispel the Dark, so long as someone believes.  If the Nightmares return, so will the Falling Knights.  Get some rest, you’ve had a long day.  Love you, goodnight.”
	“Night.”

const TTOTS = `The sun was setting behind the mountains as Darium approached the castle. Once it stood tall and proud the king’s standards flying from the towers, now the light of the setting sun only highlighted the ruins the castle had become. Grasping vines climbed their way up the side of the stonework working their way deeper into cracks, until entire portions of the castle had fallen apart.
	Darium could recall a time when Dragonhold Keep had been tended for, upkept and maintained for the history of future generations. Now, it had been forgotten, like most things from that time that should not have been.
	He walked slowly, passing closed and abandoned souvenir shops and restaurants. The castle and the buildings were silent as Darium walked quietly through the abandoned streets. A cold wind blew from the north, bringing with it the scent of rain. 
	Even though his time searching here had been brief, he already knew he was in the right place. Something had been growing in the forgotten places of the world, something dark, something evil. And now it was finally on the move.
He had found countless signs in his search, but none so concrete as the ones he had already found here. The evil was here, and it was waiting for him.
Maintaining his unhurried pace, Darium approached the gate of the castle. The drawbridge, once meticulously maintained and cared for, now sagged under its own weight. Entire planks had fallen away, due to either rot or termites. The chains that had once pulled the drawbridge upright, creaked and groaned as Darium stepped up onto the wood.
A crow cawed in the distance, echoing around the deserted ruins. As Darium stepped off the drawbridge into the keep, something crashed behind him. Dreading at what he would find, he turned around to see the eyeless face of a Nightmare watching him from a window of the closest building.
It grinned at him, its mouth splitting its black face, revealing its pointed teeth. Dread settled over Darium, as he watching the face slowly disappear into the shadows. The rumors were true, the Nightmares had returned. Warily, Darium turned back towards the keep, wondering what other dark monsters lurked within.
He had only taken half a dozen steps before, another crash sounded behind him. Glancing over his shoulder he saw three Nightmares on the drawbridge, each grinning their evil smile at him. Darium watched them for several seconds, each standing as still as the stones beside them.
Turning his back on them, Darium resumed walking towards the keep proper. They were waiting for something before attacking, what Darium was still trying to figure out. Before he had made it halfway to the keep doors, a half dozen more Nightmares appeared from the shadows, surrounding him.
	“You are not welcome here.” Darium called out, his voice ringing through the empty ruins.
	“You are the one that is not welcome here.” A raspy voice said, behind him. Calmly turning around he saw a hunter Nightmare, draped in a black cloak, its hood pulled low over its face, as it slowly walked around him on pointed feet.
	“How did you return to Crystallum?” Darium asked, his demeanor unchanged, as he clasped his hands behind his back.
	The Nightmare sneered. “Your time is fading old man.”
	“We will see about that.” Darium replied calmly. “How did you return to Crystallum?” He asked again.
	The Nightmare stopped walking, tilting its head to the side as it regarded him. After a few seconds, the twisted grin returned to its face, tilting its head back it let out a bone chilling shriek, that echoed through the ruins.
Stepping forward, Darium thrust one hand forward as a silver sword materialized in his hand piercing the monster through the neck, cutting the shriek out. With a flick of his wrist, Darium sent the monster’s head rolling away. Silence fell over the courtyard as the body collapsed to the ground, then with shrieks answering that of the first, the Nightmares charged.
A second sword appeared in his free hand as he spun into a crouch, cutting down the first two Nightmares that reached him. Straightening up, he stepped to the side as a Nightmare lunged at him, with a quick flash of silver the Nightmare dropped dead beside the others. Turning, Darium threw one of his swords, spearing a Nightmare through the chest as he dispatched another with his other blade. As another sword appeared in his hand, he reversed his grip and slammed the ends of the swords into the ground.
A ring of white fire exploded outwards from him, incinerating the remaining Nightmares. Letting go of the swords, Darium stood and started towards the keep once more, more determined than ever to find how the Nightmares were getting into Crystallum.
Pushing open the heavy wooden door of the keep, it scrapped along the stone floor, echoing through the dark hall beyond. Holding up one hand, white fire appeared, dancing between his fingers and dispelling the darkness around him.
His footsteps echoed through the room as he walked towards the stairs at the far end. The stained-glass windows lining both walls were shattered and overgrown with creeping vines. A section of the ceiling had fallen away in one corner, the splintered remnants of a bench poking out from underneath. The carpet that ran the length of the hall towards the staircase was frayed, the original color unrecognizable.
Walking faster than he had outside, Darium climbed the stairs to the second floor of the keep. From what he remembered of the first war with the Nightmares, he would find his answers in the tallest tower of the keep.
As the sun set below the horizon Darium’s only source of light came from the fire in his palm as he made his way through the abandoned castle. Doorways loomed like great gaping mouths wanting to swallow Darium and the light he held. 
As he walked, Darium thought more on the first war of Nightmares and of the first Falling Knight. Thanks to the efforts and sacrifices made by the first Falling Knights, the Nightmares and their master had been locked away for hundreds of years. It was only recently that Darium had heard rumors of their return.
He found it fitting in a way, that after all his search for the growing darkness led him back to where it had ended so long ago, and hopefully he could end it here once more.
Mounting the stars to the tower, Darium began the long ascent to the grand observatory that rested atop the tower. With each step, Darium’s feelings of dread weighed more and more heavily upon him.
As he reached the door at the top of the stairs, Darium closed his fist around the fire, throwing himself into darkness as the light extinguished. Holding his hands to the side, he summoned his blades to him once more, before pushing open the door. 
“I have been waiting for you Darium.” A deep voice growled as Darium stepped into the large circular room.
In the darkness Darium could just make out the shadowed outline of something massive in the middle of the room.
“I’m surprised it’s taken you this long. You’ve become slow in my absence.” The voice continued. “But you are too late to stop what is coming. Unfortunately, you will not be alive to see the world I create.”
With sudden speed the massive shadow charged towards Darium, shaking the tower as it ran. Two flicks of his wrists sent his swords flying at the charging monster, flashing through the darkness like shooting stars. A roar of pain echoed through the room as Darium leapt to the side, two more swords appearing in his hands. 
Dust rained from the ceiling as the monster slammed into the wall, knocking several bricks out of place. With a furious roar, the monster turned around. The silvery light of the swords imbedded in its chest illuminated the monster’s face, revealing spider-like mandibles, fangs and five eyes.
Pounding its chest, the monster charged again. Again, Darium sent his two swords flying into the charging beast before leaping over the monster’s head. Swords were already forming in his hands before he landed.
Having learned from its last charge, the monster spun around slamming its massive arm into Darium’s side. The force of the blow sent Darium flying across the room. Hitting the ground in a roll, Darium came up on one knee as the monster charged again. 
At the last moment Darium dove to the side, digging his blades deep into the monster’s legs. The tower shook as the monster roared in pain and collapsed onto the ground. Jumping to his feet, Darium leapt on the Nightmare’s back, driving both of his swords into its back. 
Howling in pain, the Nightmare rolled to the side, probably hoping to crush him underneath its massive weight. Barely managing to jump clear, Darium landed lightly on his feet, more blades appearing in his hands.
As the Nightmare struggled to its feet, Darium charged. Dodging the clumsily aimed swing, Darium drove one of his swords into the monster’s leg. Stepping aside to avoid being kicked, Darium jumped up and grabbed on of the swords protruding from the Nightmare’s chest. Pulling himself upwards, he drove his other sword up through the bottom of Nightmares head, silencing his howl of pain.
Kicking off the Nightmare’s chest, Darium landed in a crouch as the monster collapsed, shaking the tower as it hit. Breathing heavily, Darium summoned one blade as he eyed the monster carefully. It did not move.  
“A darkness is coming. You cannot stop it old man.” The voice echoed in the room around him. “All of the light, is going to be extinguished.”
Darium spun around as the voice rushed towards him with the last word. Bringing his sword up, he met the shadow blade that sought his life. Grasping it was the shadowed outline of a man. Grasping the sword with both hands, Darium could feel the malice and hate behind the sword, steadily pushing him backwards. With a spin of the wrist, Darium spun both blades to the side as he stepped forward and grabbed the shadowed figure before him.
Instantly Darium found himself looking down upon Crystallum from a high mountain as a wave of blackness washed over the land. For the first time in hundreds of years, fear filled Darium’s heart as he watched the relentless march of the dark wave. Nothing was safe from its touch.
“This is what I will do to your world. And there’s nothing that can stop me.” The voice sounded right behind Darium.
Spinning around Darium found himself complete enshrouded in shadow. 
“No!” Darium cried. “I will stop you.”
Cruel laughter echoed around him as he searched the darkness around him for any sign of hope. Faint at first, Darium saw a glimmer of light. Fighting his way through the shadow, Darium grasped the flickering light.
Images of a young elven girl filled his mind. With her teal hair pulled back into a tail, she turned to face him, studying him with her pink eyes. As he held to the light, it grew brighter and brighter until the elven girl’s face was burned into his memory.
Turning as something flashed in the corner of his eye, Darium saw another flicker of light. Grasping it he saw the face of a dragonblood man working his way through a crowded train station. 
	Looking up, Darium sought out more light. He found the next flicker to his left, dimmer and further away. With the other two held tightly in hand, Darium fought his way over to the third light.
	This time as he grasped it, the worn face of a haggard soldier came to his mind. Scruffy and scarred, the man hesitated a bottle raised halfway to his lips. Next, he caught flashes of four children, three elves and one dragonblood.
	Feeling hope start to surge within him once more, Darium looked up as another light flickered in the distance. Fighting his way through the shadow, Darium found that what he had first assumed was one light, had been two. 
Grasping them, the faces of a young man and young woman came to mind. Siblings he realized, though he wasn’t exactly sure how. Holding the five lights tightly in his chest, Darium looked up into the darkness.
“We, will stop you.”
< < < < < ~~~ > > > > >
The darkness watched the old man go, leaving behind the castle ruins. He saw everything that Darium had, a wicked grin spread across his face at the thought of it.
“So,” He said. “Darium thinks he has found his champions. No matter, they will not be able to stop what is coming.” 
He laughed then, mirthless and without the slightest trace of humor. He had set his plans into motion long, long ago. Seven hundred years was a long time to plan your vengeance. In his time absent, trapped and tormented, the people of the land had changed little. 
And despite everything Darium and his master could do, the Falling Knights had become little more than legend. With them out of the picture, and precautions made to ensure they did not return, there was no one that would be able to stand against him this time.
The corrupted dragonblood and his little science experiment with the train. The hunters sent after those who were the closest to saying the wretched oath. And finally, the unassuming stranger sent to the mountain village to retrieve the swords.
There was nothing that could stop him now. It was already too late.

const MOTGE = `The noise of the platform sounded dull to the figure watching the milling crowd.  Muted somewhat by the closed window, he couldn’t make out any specific words that were spoken, everything just seemed to blend together into one chaotic buzz.
He took a deep breath, closing his eyes as he thought of all the people before him screaming in terror at what he was about to do.  A thin smile spread across his cruel face.  He was going to change the world and no one could stop him.
	Opening his eyes he looked back out through the narrow opening he had left in the curtains.  It would be nearly impossible for someone outside to see him within the darkened room.  He had been the first person to board the train and had taken certain precautions that no one would find him, at least until it was too late.  
	He watched the people with his narrowed harsh eyes.  Some called for friends or family as they lugged their suitcases away from the train, while others were headed towards the train.  He watched with grim satisfaction as his first target approached the train.
	An elven man dressed in a slim maroon suit with the collar of his white shirt open at the top.  His blonde hair was smoothed back, clearly revealing his pointed ears.  Smiling at something his elven companion whispered in his ear, the man tipped an attendant who proceeded to haul away his luggage before turning to the slim elven woman holding to his arm.  
	He would be the first of many.
	He watched the man as he opened one of the doors for his companion then followed her inside.  Turning back towards the crowd as the elf boarded the train, his eyes landed on another pair of elves.  These were young, not adults quite yet.  A boy and a girl, both with teal hair, bidding farewell to a middle-aged elven woman with amber hair.  The youths’ mother he guessed.  It would be the last time they ever saw each other.
	Turning away from the elves, his smile grew wider as his eyes landed on someone unexpected.  His cruel smile grew wider as his eyes followed the man through the crowd.  It had been a very long time since he had seen him.  Tall, with horns growing out either side of his head, the man made his way through the crowd towards the front of the train.  Not worried in the least, the figure in the window watched until he was out of sight.
	The figure stayed by his window watching the crowd as they slowly dispersed, either to board the train or to head off into the city.  As the train’s whistle echoed through the station, and the train lurched into motion, he found the elven mother waving at someone on the train.
	“I’m so sorry for your loss.”  The man said, feeling a dark twisted mirth at the thought.  He kept his eyes on the elven mother until she had been lost to his sight, replaced by the passing of stone and mortar.
	The world would forever be changed by what he did on this train.  He had been sent with a purpose, one that most people would find appalling.  He smiled again at the thought of the horrified faces his work would bring.  
< < < < < ~~~ > > > > >
	The train rattled as it went around a curve in the track, the engine chugging as it traveled out of the city, its speed steadily rising.  The tall buildings of Concordia City soon gave way to rolling hills with the occasional tree as it headed towards the mountains in the distance.  Rykar sat with his long legs crossed underneath him.  With his eyes closed, he concentrated on his breathing.  
	He hated that he had to take the train, he would have much preferred a car or even a horse, but that would have taken much too long.  So, after pursuing all other avenues, he had ended up on the train.  
After boarding the train, he had immediately gone to his room and shut the door and hadn’t left since.  He didn’t like being around people very much.  And as it was, he had spent too much time in crowds recently, and being crammed into narrow confines with several dozen other people nearly overdid it.  
He continued his deep rhythmic breathing as the train continued to chug onwards towards its destination, which was still a very long week away.
	The last few decades had seen many new marvels and contraptions come to Crystallum.  New ways of transportation, communication, and living were fueled by electricity, crystals or Nulla powder, which ran the train and powered the lights.  But despite all these new inventions and modern conveniences, the world had only become more hectic.
Rykar was returning home from an exhausting and fruitless journey, and was looking forward to returning to his cabin on the other side of the obsidian mountains.  It was quiet there, peaceful in a way the city definitely hadn’t been, and which he doubted it ever could be with the near constant ringing of phones and blaring of car horns.
	The curtains in his cabin were drawn, blocking out almost all the light, unfortunately it did nothing for the sound. Aside from his small suitcase, which was on the bed across from him, and the long slim sword that was laying across his lap he had brought nothing else with him.  
He was alone, and he liked it that way.  When he learned all of the private rooms had been taken, he had bought out a double room for himself.  He already didn’t want to be here, so he figured he might as well make the most of it.  
His room, like many of the others, consisted of a bunk bed built into one wall with a padded bench opposite with a rack hanging above the bench for storing luggage.  A sliding door to his left led to the hall, the curtained window was to his right.
Considered tall by some, Rykar was average height when compared with his people.  Nearly six and a half feet tall, he had a slim, yet well-toned frame with long arms and legs.  With an unruly mess of dark hair, he kept his face clean shaven.  From each temple dark brown horns sprouted, angling backwards they ran along the side of his head before ending in points just above the back of his head.  His skin was tan, signs from all the work he did outside in the sun.  
He wore a black button up shirt, opened at the collar with a pair of grey slacks and a long black coat.  His shoes, worn and slightly dusty, were on the floor beside the door.
	Suddenly a crisp knock sounded on his door, followed by a high-pitched feminine voice.  "Can I interest you in any refreshments?"  The slightly muffled voice asked through the door.
	It had been less than two hours and they were already trying to talk to him.  "Just go away."  Rykar muttered under his breath.
	She didn't.  She knocked again; this time louder.  Sighing, Rykar opened his amber eyes and rose in one fluid movement, grasping the hilt of his sheathed sword as he stood.  Setting the weapon back down where he had been sitting, he walked over to the door.  Taking a deep breath, he slid it open.  At first, he thought whoever had knocked on his door had left until a slight “Ahem”, brought his eyes downwards.  
	Standing about three feet tall was a short, plump, she halfling.  She wore a deep purple dress, which matched perfectly with the carpet that ran the length of the train.  Her round face was framed by tight golden curls and was done up with makeup and a fake smile, which shrank slightly when she saw Rykar.  She was pushing a wooden cart laden with treats and snacks.
	"Do you," she began.
	"No, thank you," Rykar interrupted and shut the door.
	Before returning to his seat, he took another deep breath.  Rubbing the sides of his head just below his horns, he walked back over to the padded bench.  He knew he probably sounded harsher than he had intended, but he wasn’t sure he much cared at the moment.  There would be plenty of time to be kind later, once he had spent an ample amount of time alone.  
	Picking up his sword, he smoothly returned to his sitting position.  Closing his eyes he continued to breath in and out, willing the train to go faster, but knowing that it couldn’t, he tried to focus on something else as the train rattled down the tracks.
< < < < < ~~~ > > > > >
	Richard was a happy fellow.  He had just had a splendid time visiting his brother in the big city and to top the trip off, he had given a lecture at the university to some of the Crystallum’s brilliant young minds.  He smiled as he thought that he would soon be sitting next to his fireplace, sipping a cup of warm butterscotch milk and catching up with his children's schooling by the end of the week.
	He was a scholar and writer.  Over the last five years, he had been asked on multiple occasions to give lectures at several different important universities, and that required a lot of travel.  This trip had been the farthest he had been away from home, and he had been able to spend time with his brother, so it hadn’t been as bad as he first thought it would be.  
He might have even considered bringing his kids if it hadn’t been in the middle of their school semester.  He couldn’t bring himself to take his kids away from their education, little though it was at their age.
	One bonus for traveling so much was the fact that his home university paid for all his travels, and they usually got him the best rooms and travel arrangements available.  He had traveled by boat, plane, car and train.  His favorite way to travel was by train.  It was peaceful and he got to meet so many new people.  He had met his wife on a train similar to this one.  The memory made him smile.  He hated traveling by boat.  He had done it once, and that was the first and last time he would be doing that.  Luckily, his university understood.
	Richard was a halfling, and proud of it.  He came from a long line of respectable halflings, ranging all the way back to the Steel Age.  He was a perfect height at three feet and two inches exactly, and his stomach protruded just the right amount, so that he could barely see his toes if he tried hard enough, though he rarely tried at all.
	He had rich curly hair the color of milk chocolate with streaks of grey swirls.  He was wearing a green sleeved cloak that ended just above his large hairy bare feet.  He was wearing his favorite pair of trousers with a cream-colored button up shirt and blue vest.  His battered old brown bowler hat sat on the sea of curls on his head and the round spectacles on his nose magnified his intelligent brown eyes ever so slightly.
	In his hand he held a leather suitcase, which held his most recent writings, along with a drawing of a Falling Knight from his niece.  The legends of the magnificent warriors always excited young children.   They even excited Richard, who had spent considerable time studying them.  Part of him still wasn’t convinced that they were real, the more rational part of him that was.  The more hopeful and speculative side of him believed that they must have been real.  Legends and heroes of a bygone era.
As he walked through the train, towards the dining car, he passed a few people along the way, including the treat trolley and she halfling pushing it.  He eyed the chocolate phoenix cookies for several long moments before forcing himself to turn away.  He would get himself a treat at the dining car.  
Whenever he passed someone, he was always sure to tip his hat towards them and give them a warm smile, as respectable halflings do.  He saw several elves, a couple woodlings and a handful of satyrs, but most of the people he passed were humans.
	When he reached the dining car, he made his way over to one of the lower sitting tables, made specifically for the shorter of the races, those being halflings and woodlings.  Glancing out the window he could just see Concordia City start to disappear in the distance giving way to the luscious green landscape that surrounded the city, similar to that area he called home. 
	Concordia was one of the most advanced cities in Crystallum.  It was there that cellphones had first been created nearly fifty years ago by a Kael Voxen, who some considered to be the greatest scientist of the century.  To think they had come so far in such a short amount of time.  Incredible, Richard thought.  He wondered briefly what it must have been like in the Steel Age without the modern conveniences that they enjoyed now.
	Taking his seat on the purple padded bench, he set his suitcase on the table in front of him.  Opening the clasps of the faded leather bag, he took a cursory glance at his niece’s drawing of a halfling woman in flaming armor, before pulling out his papers and pen.  After ordering his food from the woodling waiter, he started to write as the scenery rushed by.
< < < < < ~~~ > > > > >
	"Look a phoenix!"  Rayla said, looking out the window at the flaming bird flying overhead.
	"Cool."  Rillan replied lazily.  “Not like we’ve seen one hundreds of times before.”
	"You could at least act like you're excited."  Rayla said.
	"Woah," came Rillan's response.  “So cool.”
	Rayla rolled her eyes at her twin brother's stupidity.  Then glared at him over her shoulder only to see that he was laying across one of the benches in their room with one arm draped over his eyes, his cellphone resting on his chest.  Rayla shook her head in disgust.  Sometimes her brother was the best person in the world, other times, well, not so much.  Like when he was tired or hungry.
	They were both elves from the northern forests, or at least their parents were.  They had just come from spending a month with their mother in Concordia City and would spend the next month with their father.  Each month they would take this week-long train ride between their parent’s houses, it definitely wasn’t the highlight of her month, but she still got to see both her parents which was more important to her.  It had taken a while after her parents had gotten divorced before they had found a system where they could spend quality time with both of them.
	They had just turned seventeen and for their birthday their mother had given them wands, made from shed unicorn horns, along with a spell book for each of them.  She had seen her parents perform magic many times before, but now she was old enough to actually learn to use it herself.  And she could not wait.  Unfortunately, their mom had made them promise they wouldn’t try to use any magic until their father could show them how to properly do so.  She had warned them that more than one person had been terribly injured practicing magic unsupervised.
	Rayla was just shorter than her brother, with a slim elven build and long dark teal hair that fell past her shoulders and curled slightly at the end. Her eyes were bright pink, and like all elves her skin was a deep golden tan and her ears were pointed.  She was wearing a white and light blue dress with sleeves that opened widely at the elbows, it blossomed out from her waist, opening at the front to reveal her gray tights and black boots.  The outfit had been another gift from her mom for her birthday.	
	Rillan had a slightly bulkier build than his sister.  He also had teal hair which he kept short and spiky.  His eyes, which were currently still covered by his arm, were deep purple.  He was wearing a white button-up shirt which had been untucked from his grey breeches.  Around his neck lay a silver chain that held a light blue cloak in place at his shoulders.	
A knock came at the door and the person on the other side announced that the food trolley was on the other side.  Rillan immediately jumped up and ran to the door.  Rayla just shook her head again and looked out at the passing scenery as she thought.
	Rayla had waited her whole life to perform magic, and now that the time had nearly arrived for her to start learning, she found that she was nervous.  When she was younger watching her parents perform magic always seemed so mystical and amazing.  
But the older she got the more she learned just how dangerous magic could be.  Of course, the sort of magic she would be learning wouldn’t be very dangerous at least not at first.  But it still made her hesitant.  What if she was bad at it?  Like really bad.  What if she accidently blew something up?  Or maybe, worst of all, what if she couldn’t even perform magic at all?
	“Whatcha thinkin bout?”  Rillan asked through a mouthful of food.
	“Magic.”  Rayla replied absently mindedly, as she continued staring out the window.
	“Cool.  Do you know what’s magic?  How they can get these little chocolates to look like dragons while still tasting amazing!”  Rillan sad.
	Rayla turned to see Rillan holding a small clear bag stuffed with, just as he had said, dragon shaped chocolates.  He popped several in his mouth at once, then when he noticed she had turned around offered the bag towards her.  Shrugging she walked away from the window and picked a few chocolates out of the bag.
	Looking down at the candy, she briefly wondered where the dragons had gone.  It was widely accepted that dragons were real, but no one had seen any for thousands of years, much longer than the last Falling Knight sighting.  With long and sleek bodies covered with hundreds of rock-hard scales that were said to glisten in the moonlight they were said to have manes of pure white hair around their heads with two horns sprouting from their foreheads.  They were majestic and powerful creatures and unlike any other creatures, it was said they didn’t need wings to fly.  
Some said they were hibernating, others that they died off.  Rayla thought they were still out there somewhere, watching and biding their time for when they would be needed most.
< < < < < ~~~ > > > > >
	Sorcha knelt on the floor of her small room, breathing in the fresh air as it tore into the room through the open window with a fury.  The air was chill, cutting right through her shirt, but that didn't bother Sorcha.  She loved the cold, it made her feel alive.  
	Her face split into a grin as a particularly strong gust of wind brought the scent of snow and the mountains as it hit her in the face sending her hair blowing back.  Yes, this was where she truly belonged.  In the mountains, not stuck up in some office in the stuffy, dirty city.
	She had been longing to return to the mountains for nearly a year now but work had always come up with some reason for her not to leave before she could get away.  Now she had finally managed to escape, without having to evade dozens of excuses along the way.
	The wind blew her long raven hair across her face, as it rushed through the room.  It tore at her, longing for her to come and run with it like she used to when she was young.  When she was a kid, she would spend all day outside running through the forests and the mountains going wherever she wanted, wherever the wind took her.  Soon enough she would walk those paths again.
	Opening her eyes, she stood and walked over to the window and stuck her head out, letting her long hair trail behind her.  The train was beginning to slope upwards now as it continued towards the obsidian mountains, rising like giant black teeth from the earth.  She squinted her eyes as the wind buffeted against her face, making it difficult to keep her eyes open for very long.
	A pounding on her door, brought her back to reality.  Pulling her head back inside, she regretfully closed the window.  Then smoothing the hair out of her face, she crossed over to the door and opened it to find a she halfling pushing a cart of sweets.
	"I have an order for Sorcha."  She declared, pulling a covered silver plate from the bottom shelf of the trolley and holding it up.  "You know,” she said as she offered up the plate. “You can eat in the dining car with the other passengers."
	"Yes, I know thank you.  But I prefer to dine alone."  Sorcha replied, smiling at the halfling as she accepted the covered plate.
	"Of course, dear."  The halfling said, smiling a half-forced smile at her.
	Sorcha nodded at her before sliding the door closed.  Her stomach rumbled as she crossed over to the padded bench.  Her room was small, situated in the last passenger car of the train, with only a small floor space between the bench and bed, but she didn’t mind.  Sitting down, she could feel the coldness of the food through the plate, taking the cover off she attacked her food.

	Vrain was just leaving the dining car as the halfling pushing the treat trolley pushed through the double doors, pushing her cart back to the kitchen to restock or return the trolley, he wasn't sure which.  He didn't really care.  It wasn’t any of his business what other people were doing.  He only wished people had the same courtesy for him.  It seemed like you couldn’t go anywhere without people up in your face about everything.	
	All he wanted to do was find a quiet place where he could finish his book, without any interruptions.  Unfortunately, the person occupying the room next to his was practicing some sort of loud instrument, and they were quite bad at it, driving him away from his rooms in search of a quieter reading place.  Fortunately, the person he had been assigned to share a room with didn’t end up boarding the train, leaving him his own room.
	Vrain was a dwarf, which might have been the reason people gave him odd looks when they saw he was carrying a book.  It wasn't often you saw a well-muscled, heavily scarred dwarf reading a book.  Well, Vrain wasn't like other dwarves.  He had spent the last fifteen years fighting full time at the border of the Black Caves.  Which he had always thought was a bad name for a ravine.  But he wasn't paid to think, he was paid to fight.  
	Vrain was a magic user which made him stand out even more than the fact that he enjoyed reading.  There were few magic wielding dwarves.  His belief and powers had saved him and others more than once, so he didn't care what others said, though that wasn't new.  He had never bothered with what other people thought about him.  
What did they know anyway?  Nothing that’s what.
	He had been recently forced into retirement, which was happening more and more nowadays.  After serving as a general for the last ten years he was finally returning to the place where he had been born on the other side of the Obsidian Mountains.  His homeland.  The homeland of every dwarf lay far to the north, past the elven forests.  A land of rolling plains with only a few incredibly tall mountains.  Unfortunately, this train ride was only a small part of that journey.
	After passing through more cars than he cared to count, he finally came to an empty car with benches and tables for reading, talking or playing card games.  He even thought he saw a Retan board on one table with the game pieces scattered across the table.  He had never had time for games. 
	Finding a seat with good natural lighting he climbed up and opened his book and began to read.

const WFC = `Sleet crashed noisily against the window, shaking the glass panes and making Mariah feel grateful that she was sitting with her back to a roaring fire, well, roaring might have been a bit generous, she thought.  Holding her cards in one hand, and a mug of steaming hot chocolate in the other, she took a small sip, as she studied the cards with her dark blue eyes, the lights from the Christmas tree behind her cast multicolored spotlights on them. 
	Mariah, much to the chagrin of those around her especially her parents, had always been particular about the color of her hair; insisting that she wasn’t a ginger or a brunette, but asked that she be called an auburnette.  A word that she had made up and was rather proud of herself for doing so.  She was wearing her favorite Christmas pajamas, over which she wore her baby blue bathrobe, tied around her waist with a white strip of soft fabric.
	“Do you have any candy canes?”  She asked, peeking over her cards at Theo, her older brother.
	“Go fish.”  Theo replied, his face a mask.  He had always had had a better Go Fish face then she did.
	Theodore or Theo, as everyone except his parents called him, was two years older than she was.  He had dark eyes and brown hair and was the tallest of small group, and therefore he was the leader of their little band. 
	Mariah let out an exasperated sigh as she set down her coco and reached for the deck of cards sitting on the floor between them.  The card she drew had a brightly colored Christmas tree with lights and various colored ornaments.  Adding it to her hand, she picked up her drink and took another sip.
	“Uh, Mariah,” Clary began timidly, “Do you have a candy canes?” 
	Mariah looked over at her friend, Clarissa smiled shyly at her as Mariah handed over her candy cane card, leaving only three cards left in her hand, the Christmas tree, a funny looking elf with pointy shoes and ears and a snowman.  Clarissa, was the same age as Mariah, with dark curly hair, and green eyes.  Clary wasn’t as outgoing as Mariah was, and stayed quite most of the time in large groups, but once you got to know her she was fiercely loyal.
	“Do you have any presents?”  This time Clary addressed the question to Theo.
	Theo scowled as he handed over his card, he didn’t like losing, and currently he wasn’t winning.  Clary added another match to her other four on the floor in front of her, leaving only one card in her hand.  
	“Do you have Santa’s sleigh?”  Clary asked Jake, her older brother.
	“Go fish.”
	Jake was a year younger than Theo, and a year older than both of the girls.  He had flaming red hair, and round glasses, which only served enlarge his mischievous grey eyes.  Clary drew the last card her face beaming, as she set down her sixth match with her last card.
	“Mariah, do you have a snowman?”  Jake asked.
	Mariah grudgingly handed over her card, consoling herself with more hot chocolate, the marshmallows had all melted, leaving a foam on top, which was one of her favorite parts.
	“Mariah, do you have a reindeer?”  Jake asked, holding his last card in his hand.
	“No, go fish.”  Mariah replied, excited that she was finally able to keep a card.
	Jake shrugged his shoulders leaning back, and slurping the last of his coco from the bottom of his cup.  
	“Jake, do you have any reindeer?”  Theo asked quickly, before waiting for a response he turned to his sister.  “Do you have a snowman, elf and Christmas tree?  Maria rolled her eyes as she handed over the cards.  Accepting the cards, Theo paired them up with the ones in his hand and set them down.
	With the game over, Mariah looked around the circle, Theo had six matches, Jake had four, Clary had seven and she had one.  One.  That’s all?  She sighed, shaking her head, she had lost all the games that night, first monopoly, which she didn’t like very much, then Scrabble, the others had said auburnette didn’t count as a word, and now Go Fish.  
	“It appears that Clary is the winner.”  Theo announced, gathering all the cards to put them back in the tin box they came from.
	“Bed time!”  The Wilson’s mom called, as she came into the living room where the kids had played their games.  Average height, with blue eyes and brown hair, that fell to her shoulders, she smiled at the kids sitting in a circle on the floor.
	“Already?”  Theo asked, looking over his shoulder at the clock.
	“It’s nearly ten o’clock.”  Theo’s Dad said, coming in the room behind his wife.  He had dark hair and eyes like his son, and he was wearing the most horrifying Christmas sweater Mariah had ever seen.
	“What are you wearing?”  Mariah blurted out before she could stop herself, pointing at her dad’s sweater.
	“Oh this?  Do you like it?  I little present from grandpa.”  Dad replied, beaming proudly.
	Clary and the two boys stifled laughs at the horrified look on Mariah’s face.
“Is everything you two need upstairs?”  Mom asked, turning to Jake and Clary.  They had been staying at the Wilson’s house for the past couple of days, and due to a winter storm delay, would be staying that night as well.
“Yes ma’am.”  Clary replied.  Jake nodded.
“I’ll take care of those; you say goodnight and head on upstairs.”  Mom insisted, as Clary started gathering the empty coco mugs.
Mariah stood up, yawning and stretching her arms above her head.  Saying goodnight to her mom, she crossed over to dad, careful to keep her eyes anywhere except on his sweater, and said goodnight.	
After brushing their teeth, they said goodnight to each other and wished each other merry Christmas.  Mariah opened her bedroom door, sitting on her nightstand beside her bed was a short brilliantly lit Christmas tree.  After their visit to grandmas, she had come home to find this small tree lighting up her room.
She smiled at it as she crossed over to her bed.  Her parents still wouldn’t admit to placing it there, but she knew they had.  Crossing over to her bed, she retrieved her teddy bear, Francis, from his position on top of her pillow.  Incredibly soft and fuzzy he had auburn fur with a blue and green stripped scarf tied around his neck.
Francis in hand, Mariah dimmed the lights on the diminutive tree and walked to the foot of her bed where Clary was waiting for her, amid a sea of blankets, pillows and sleeping bags.  Clary had two flashlights on, one of which she handed to Mariah as she came around the bed.  Accepting the light, Mariah fell into the soft embrace of the blankets.  Francis held tight, she shined her flashlight beam at the ceiling, and as she started to drift off to sleep, Mariah thought of the wonderful day they would have tomorrow.
	Mariah woke with a start, sitting straight up, which was a little hard as she was twisted up in a sleeping bag and several blankets.  Something in her dream had woken her up.  She didn’t even remember falling asleep.  And what was that bright light in her face?  Reaching out her hands, she closed her fingers around her flashlight.  She had fallen asleep with it still on, and judging from the breathing next to her, Clary had also fallen asleep, though it appears she had turned her light off before she did so.
	Looking at her digital clock that sat atop her dresser, it was three in the morning.  Untangling herself from her sleeping bag, Mariah stood up, flashlight still in hand.  Slipping on her bathrobe and slippers, she carefully stepped over her sleeping friend and left the room, closing the door part way behind her.  Her parents’ door was closed and there wasn’t any light coming from underneath it.  As it should be this late at night.  Or early?  She was never sure how to refer to these unholy hours.
	Slowly she made her way to the bathroom, the silence and darkness of the house engulfing her as she walked.  After getting a drink of water, she started creeping back to her bedroom, when she heard something.  It was quite and hard to hear, but something or someone was definitely making noise on this otherwise silent night.  It sounded like humming.  Looking back at her parents’ door, she saw it was still closed, and the room beyond was still dark, from what she could tell.
	Slowly and carefully, she crept to the edge of the stairs to listen.  The noise was louder now, and it definitely sounded like humming.  Heart hammering in her chest, she creeped down the first couple of steps.  The lower she went the louder the sound came, eventually it was loud enough for her to make out the tune, it sounded like Jingle Bells.  Suddenly something touched her arm.  Mariah, jumped in surprise, barley able to contain her shout of surprise.  Turning around she saw Clary, standing bleary eyed behind her.
	“What you doin?”  She asked sleepily, rubbing her eye.
	Mariah pressed her fingers to her lips, signaling quiet.  She then pointed down the stairs.  Clary looked confused for a moment, then she must have heard the humming, for all traces of exhaustion quickly left, replaced by excitement. 
	“Go wake the boys.”  Mariah whispered as quiet as she could.  “I’ll make sure he doesn’t leave.”
	Clary nodded enthusiastically and hurried off down the hall.  It was only after she was gone, that she wasn’t sure who was even in their living room or how she would keep them from leaving.  Exerting great patience, Mariah stayed where she was on the stairs until Clary returned a moment later, having dawned a bath robe herself and followed by two tired looking boys, Jake’s glasses were sideways and he yawned widely as they gathered at the top of the stairs.
	Before they could say something and ruin everything, Mariah signaled for silence and pointed down the stairs.  Then without waiting any longer, Mariah led the way down the stairs in a crouch, one step at a time going as quiet as she could, avoiding all the steps and places that creaked.  Reaching the bottom of the stairs, she slowly peaked around the corner, then quickly retreated.
	“What is it?”  Theo hissed.
	Without answering, Mariah peaked around the corner again and looked into the living room, the others did the same, the only light came from the Christmas tree.  The fireplace which was set against one wall was dark, the couch faced the fireplace and the tree was placed proudly in the corner.  Only she couldn’t see the tree, because there was a large someone dressed all in red standing in front of it.  
He was nearly as tall as the seven-foot tree wearing a large deep red coat that ended just above his knees.  He had a large brown belt tied around his substantial waist, with dark green mittens tucked between the leather and his coat.  His pants were an even darker shade of red than his coat, tucked into shiny coal black boots.  On the top of his head, covering most of his snow-white hair was a red Santa hat, that matched the color of his coat, the hat like the coat, was trimmed with white wool, the hat boasting a large puffball on its tip.  
Santa Claus was bending over next to their Christmas tree, with a large brown sack next to him.  By the time he finished humming jingle bells, he cinched the top of his sack with a golden cord and stood up straight.  As he turned around, Mariah and the others scooted back, but only enough to not be seen.  He had the most brilliant blue eyes Mariah had ever seen; his bushy, curly, blinding white beard ended a few inches short of the golden belt buckle.  He didn’t look old, but he didn’t look young either, it was like his face had a timeless look to it, though he still looked slightly old Mariah decided, as Santa should. 
Santa bent over and picked up a piece of paper that was on the coffee table next to the couch, mumbling to himself what was written on the paper, he looked over his shoulder at the clock and then back at the note.  
“I’ve got time.”  He said to himself, more clearly than his reading.  He had a strong rich voice, that made Mariah smile.
Following the directions on the note they had left, Santa left the living room, taking the hallway down to the kitchen.  The note had been Mariah’s idea, just in case something like this happened, it would get Santa out of the living room, it read:
The plate of cookies was too big to put in the living room, it is in the kitchen with a tall glass of milk.
P.S. There are also carrots for the reindeer.
	-Sincerely Mariah and Theo Wilson, and Jake and Clary Smith
	Once Santa had disappeared, Mariah came out from her hiding spot and quietly ran to the fireplace, her slipper shod feet barely making any noise on the carpet, the others followed close behind.  The grate of the fireplace along with the wood and soot were all gone.  The front of the fireplace now opened up like a doorway.  Leaning against the inside of the chimney, which was about twice as large as it was before, was a gleaming silver ladder.  Snowflakes fell silently around it.
	Mariah immediately stepped inside and ran a hand along the gleaming surface, it wasn’t cold like she had expected it to be.  Then, without knowing why she did it, she put her foot on the first rung and started climbing up the ladder.
	“Mariah, where are you going?”  Theo hissed at her, coming into the chimney.
	“I want to see the sleigh.  Don’t you?”  Mariah softly called back, not pausing as she continued her climb.
	After a brief moment of hesitation, Mariah felt Theo mount the ladder below her.  When she reached the top rung, Mariah poked her head out of the chimney and into the chilly night air, it was dark, cold and snowing.  There wasn’t much to see, aside from their snowman in the yard, and their neighbor’s massive inflatable Christmas tree, then she heard a sound behind her.  Turning her head, she gasped at what she saw.  Quickly climbing the rest of the way out of the chimney and onto the roof, she ran over to the gleaming sled.  It was bright red, with gold runners and rails.  
	“Wow.”  She breathed softly, her breath pluming out before her face in a cloud.
	“Its huge!”  Theo exclaimed, appearing next to her.
	It was indeed massive.  There was a large cushioned chair at the front of the vehicle, in front of the chair was a large wooden panel with various buttons and switches that resembled a car’s dashboard.  Set into the center of the dashboard was a globe that was set partially into the dash.  There was a single step that led up into the sleigh, behind the front chair there was another larger cushioned bench and behind that there was a place for Santa’s sack, kind of like a truck bed, with golden railings all along the top of the smooth wood painted red.
	“Guys come look.”  Clary whispered excitedly.  She was standing at the front of the sleigh, looking at something that was in front of it.
	Running up behind her friend, Mariah saw what she had been looking at.  Eight magnificent reindeer lined up in two rows of four, their backs were higher than dad was tall, their antlers gleamed in the moonlight.  Each reindeer had a saddle like piece of leather that went over their backs, that was connected on either side by a string of bells.  The bells connected them to the reindeer in front of them and the sleigh behind them.
	“Hey, look!  That ones’ an auburnette.”  Mariah, exclaimed pointing at the front reindeer on the left.
	Theo rolled his eyes.  He was probably about to tell her that there was no such thing as an auburnette reindeer, let alone an auburnette person, but something made him stop.  Santa’s sack flew out of the chimney and landed in the back of the sleigh with impossible ease and silence.  
	“Santa’s coming.”  Jake said nervously, “What do we do?”
	“Follow me.”  Mariah replied immediately.
	Before anyone could object, she ran over to the sleigh, and placing one foot on the footstep, climbed up into Santa’s sleigh.  Climbing over the bench behind the large chair, she climbed in next to Santa’s sack.  Theo followed after his sister; Jake quickly followed as well.  When Clary didn’t follow her brother, Mariah peaked her head out of the sleigh and gestured for her to hurry.  After glancing back towards the chimney, from which the top of Santa’s hat could now be seen, she rushed forward and climbed in beside Mariah.
	“Now what?”  Jake asked, in a hushed whisper.
	“We wait until, Santa gets in the sleigh than we hope out.”  Theo replied, also in a hushed whisper.
	The sled groaned slightly and dipped to one side as Santa stepped into the sleigh.  Mariah peaked over the top of the bench, Santa had just sat down in the big chair and appeared to be pushing some buttons as he hummed another Christmas tune to himself.  Someone was tugging on her sleeve, looking behind her she saw Clary trying to pull her to the back of the sleigh for their escape.  Reluctantly, she followed Clary to the back of the sleigh where the boys were waiting. 
	Already they had seen more than she ever could have hoped, but she still didn’t want to leave.  This could be their only chance to see the North Pole, or meet the elves or see Santa’s workshop.  But Clary’s tugging was relentless, so she followed her friend to the back of sleigh.  Maybe next year.
	“Ready?”  Theo asked, once they had gathered at the back of the sleigh.
	Three heads nodded in return, though one auburnette didn’t wasn’t too happy about it.  Theo pushed himself up into a crouch and placed his hands on the back railing.  Then before he could hop out, they were all thrown against the back of the sleigh as they took flight. 
	“Ha, ha, ha, merry Christmas!”  Santa bellowed, his rich voice echoing boldly in the winter night. 
Did he just say ha, ha, ha?  Mariah was suddenly very confused, the others appeared just as confused as she felt.  Wasn’t Santa supposed to say ho ho ho?
Looking up, she saw the clouds were streaming by impossibly fast, pushing herself up, she looked over the edge of the sleigh at the houses streaming past, then in a bright white flash, it was all gone replaced by endless plains of white snow.

const TDD = `	Everyone knew that Onyx City was not only one of Crystallum’s largest and most advanced cities, but also one of the most corrupt.  With the rich living in luxury and the poor in fear, the politicians made vain promises about trying to clean up the streets and end the gang wars that were ravaging the city.  In Andelyn’s experience those promises were for one purpose and one purpose only.  Votes.
	She still remembered the first attack by the Crimson Pearls against the Dying Tide, a rival gang which had died out a few years back.  Despite the large task force the police had put together to stop the gangs, violence still raged throughout the city.  For ten years the gangs had fought against each other and against the police until only two gangs remained.  
	The Crimson Pearls were the oldest and largest gang, led by Katrina The Pearl Crimson.  The Emerald Roses had established themselves early in the war by wiping out or assimilating several other gangs in rapid succession.
	The task force that had been put together to end the gang war seemed to always be one step behind, serving more as damage control rather than something that could bring the criminals to justice and end the violence.  
	Until now.
	Officer Andelyn Hawthorne, or better known by her friends as Andy, swore under her breath as she hit her head for what felt like the hundredth time on the vent ceiling.  After a few more choice words, Andy continued forward.  Crawling along on her stomach, she slowly inched forward through the vent.  
	Crawling through vents was not nearly as easy or exciting as the movies or books she read made them out to be.  They were dark, incredibly filthy and small.  Lucky for Andy, she was small too.  Coming in at exactly five feet, she was over a foot shorter than the average Dragonblood.  
Her height didn’t bother her, at least not anymore.  But if the tips of her horns hit the vent roof one more time, she would have to come back here with a warrant to tear the abandoned warehouse down.
	When asked what she did with her time off, she never answered crawling through cramped dirty spaces.  Her usual answer would have been reading one of her mystery novels while sipping a warm mug of butterscotch milk.  But sometimes to make a difference you had to do something dirty.  And Andy intended to make a difference.
	That’s why she had enrolled in the police academy.  She was determined to make a difference.  Though she was starting to rethink coming all the way out to the docks to crawl through a cramped space on a hunch.  
	She moved as quickly as she could while making as little noise as possible, which was a lot easier said then done.  Pausing at a vent that overlooked the dark interior of the warehouse, she took a few deep breathes of dust free hair.  Wiping the sweat off of her face, she scanned the darkness below her for any sign of movement.  
	Suddenly a light flicked on.  Warm yellow light spilled from the windows of an office bathing the dark warehouse in its warm glow.  The blinds were drawn over the windows, only giving Andy a glimpse of a dark silhouette as they walked across the room.  The office itself was in the upper corner of the warehouse just around the bend for Andy.
	Part of her wondered what on Crystallum she was doing.  The building she was currently crawling through was nowhere near her normal patrol route, and if she got caught there would be no backup for her unsanctioned mission.  Since she had joined the Onyx City Police Department, or OCPD, a year ago she had been suspicious of one of her fellow officers.  
	Onyx City was well known for its corruption, and if her detective novels taught her anything, it was that corrupt cops were always high on the mafia’s pay roll.  She realized that suspicions born from stereotypes from books was definitely not the same as hard fact, so she had watched and waited, and finally her suspicions were proved true.
	Two days previous she had overheard officer Rogen, a dwarven man with an unbelievably large mustache, talking to someone on the phone.  He had spoken of a meeting with an informant at the docks.  She had been unable to hear anything else due to the fact that someone had spilled coffee behind her causing a commotion that drowned out the rest of the call.
	 Knowing she couldn’t go to Chief Archer with her suspicions with only a vague overheard conversation as fact, she had decided to take matters into her own hands.  
	It hadn’t been difficult for Andy to find the warehouse Rogen had mentioned.  After pulling up the GPS data for Rogen’s cruiser while he was in the restroom, she had quickly located an abandoned warehouse on the docks near the outskirts of town that Rogen had been to several times.  
	Memorizing the location she had returned to her desk, just as Rogen returned to his.  Heart pounding in her chest she knew she had to go to this informant meeting.  Even if Rogen was meeting with a regular informant and not a member of one of the gangs, at least she would know.
	Tonight, she was going to prove to Chief Archer that she was ready to be put on the task force that fought against the gang.  Probably.  If she didn’t die that was.
	Hearing a door open somewhere below her, the sound of footsteps echoed around the dark warehouse as several dark figures made their way to the lit office.  Recognizing the profile of the short and beefy officer Rogen as one of the figures, Andy quickly turned from the vent and continued crawling towards the office.
	Rounding the turn in the vent, she could see the light from the office shining up through the vent just ahead of her, casting yellow lines into the vent.  Heart pounding in her chest, she quickened her pace until she reached the vent.
Peering through the slits in the vent she looked down at an office that was not nearly as run down as the rest of the warehouse.  The wood paneled walls were clean and in good repair, and the short dark red carpet was clean.  Directly opposite Andy was a door that led out to the rest of the warehouse.  To her left a window overlooked the dark water below and directly below her, she could just see the corner of a large wooden desk.
She had barely taken all of this in when a sharp knock echoed through the room. 
“Come.”  An oily voice called from below her.
The door was pushed open and officer Rogen flanked by two other people entered the office.  Andy recognized Rogen’s companions as officer Pepperthorn a slender elvish woman with dark hair, and detective Sloan a human who certainly didn’t act like one.  He was holding a slim folder and an annoyed expression.  All three were dressed all in black.
Moving quickly and quietly, Andy pushed a button on her watch to record the conversation.
	“I don’t want to hear your excuses.  You’re late.”  The man below Andy stated cooly.
	“Fine, don’t listen, just pay.”  detective Sloan growled, tossing the folder onto the desk.
	The folder disappeared from Andy’s view as the man below her picked it up.  After a few moments of silence, the man scoffed in disgust.  
“You think The Pearl will really pay you this much for the meager work you do for us?  The nerve of you oath breakers is unbelievable.  She’ll pay you what you originally agreed to.”  He said.
	“Playing both sides is getting more and more dangerous.”  Sloan replied.  “Times are changing, and so must the wages.  The Roses approached us just last week offering a great deal more then what you pay us.  We came to you first for a chance to let you keep our loyalty.”
	So, they’re working for the Crimson Pearls, Andy thought making a mental note of that.  The unseen man growled, throwing the folder down onto the table, it slid just far enough for Andy to see what was in the it.  
“Loyalty of oath breakers only goes as deep as the pockets of the ones paying them.”  The man said.  “You would betray her trust?  Go back on your agreement?”  
Squinting through the vent, Andy could just make out the contents of the folder.  From what little she could see, she guessed it was a payroll of sorts, for every corrupt cop in the city that worked for the Crimson Pearls.  Andy’s heart beat a little faster.  If she could get her hands on that file, it would be evidence that Chief Archer wouldn’t refuse, and it would get a lot of corrupt cops off the streets.  That is if she could get the file.
	“What trust?”  Sloan asked in disgust.  “Your criminals and we work for as you put it, whoever as the deepest pockets, which at the moment is not you.”
“You really are quite disgusting.  I’ve seen pigs with more loyalty than you.”  The oily voiced man said the coolness in his voice melting away with every word he spoke.  “However,” he said after a brief moment of silence, the coolness in his voice returning.  “In light of these new developments I will talk to The Pearl and see what she thinks about your proposition.”
 	“Now, I think it is time you leave.  I will talk to the Pearl and see what she decides your fate to be.  It is not wise to cross her.”  The man said as he walked around the desk, for the first time giving Andy a good look at him.  
	She recognized him almost immediately as Cool Joe, one of Katrina Crimson’s top men.  The force had known he was working with her for years but had never been able to put him away because they lacked the evidence, until now.  He was a slim man with oiled back black hair and the signature dark leather jacket of the Crimson Pearls, which had the gang’s dark red logo embossed on the back.
	Andelyn had enough evidence to put him and the three who were just there away for good, but if she wanted to get all the other corrupt cops, should would need more evidence.  She needed that file. 
	Just as she was trying to plan a way to retrieve it without being caught and killed, she was given the perfect opening.  
“Let me walk you back down to your vehicles.  As a token of good will and trust that you will accept The Pearl’s offer when she extends it.”  Cool Joe said calmly, the coldness to his voice having returned as he walked the corrupt cops to the door.
	Andy watched almost breathlessly as he opened the door and escorted his guests out before closing the door behind them.  She could hardly believe her luck.  
Feeling a bead of sweat trickle down the side of her face Andy reached forward and pushed the vent open.  
With a creaking that she was sure would be overheard the vent opened a few inches before stopping on its rusted hinges.  Taking a deep breath, she shoved it a little harder.  This time it swung all the open.  Moving quickly, she swung her legs out and dropped into the office.  Landing softly, if rather clumsily on the crimson carpet in a cloud of dust and cobwebs.  
Snatching the folder off of the desk, a quick flip through the pages confirmed her suspicions of what the file was.  Slipping the file into her jacket, she looked up at the vent and suddenly realized she hadn’t thought of how to get back into the vent.
Just when she was dismissing the idea of climbing onto the desk and jumping, she heard voices outside the door.
She was trapped.
< < < < < ~~~ > > > > >
	Thallan walked with his head down and hands shoved deep into the pockets of his dark leather jacket.  In between patches of shadow, he passed through different colored strips of light coming from the dozens of colorful neon signs that shone down on him.  You had to truly look hard to find a building in Onyx City that didn’t have at least glowing signs lighting the night.  
	Tonight, Thallan was in the Under City, which is where he spent most of his nights these days.  The streets of the Under City ran like great canals all through Onyx City covered by metal grates that let sunlight and sign light shine down in ribbons of light.  The gates had entry and exit points at nearly ever intersection, with stairs and elevators for those who didn’t drive hover cars.  Thallan liked to think of Under City as the basement of Onyx City, a basement that you through all the trash and useless junk to forget about.
	Thallan didn’t look up as a car drove past splashing through the various puddles that had been left by the rain storm from earlier that day.  He could have chosen to take the car with the others, but he liked being alone, and he enjoyed walking.  It gave him time to think, even if he did have to sidestep the occasional pile of trash bags.  He didn’t have to worry about the homeless very often as they steered clear as soon as they saw his jacket and the crimson symbol on his back.  
	Spotting a shadowy figure across the street, Thallan looked up and started humming a tune that had been stuck in his head.  The figure disappeared into the shadows just as quickly as they arrived.  For the first time that day Thallan smiled.  It had been a good day overall, all of his pickups had gone well and he hadn’t run into any Emerald Roses.  He was heading to the last pickup of the evening, then he would be able to get some food and sleep.
	As he came around a corner, his destination, a small white shop with bright neon green lights, came into view.  It was built into the walls of the canal like street, rising up three stories before getting cut off by the metal grates.  If his memory proved correct, a massive skyscraper mall was directly above the small hardware store in the Upper City.
	Walking up to the glass sliding door, he stopped and looked inside.  Most of the lights were out, which made sense as it was long past closing time.  The only person in the store was lit in the spotlight of the only light in the store.  An elderly halfling stood behind a counter against the far wall fiddling with something that he promptly dropped when he saw Thallan standing outside the door.
	Thallan waved and gave a cheerful smile before pointing at the door.  The man disappeared behind his desk for a moment before reappearing with a remote that he pointed at the door.  With a click and a slight hiss, the door slid open.
	The humid air that had been clinging to Thallan as he walked through the streets quickly faded as he walked into the air-conditioned shop, which was a little chillier than he liked.  As Thallan walked between the metal shelves to towards the halfling, the small man pushed another button on his remote, closing the door with another hiss.  
The halfling, Therin, if Thallan remembered correctly, had a large bald spot on the top of his head that reflected the light above him.  The ring of brown hair that circled his head was streaked with grey, his worn face was clean shaven, if one didn’t take his exceptionally bushy eyebrows into consideration that was.
	“Just you tonight?”  Therin asked hopefully
	“Depends.”  Thallan replied, leaning against the counter in a relaxed manner.  
	“On what?”  Therin asked, after waiting a moment to see if Thallan would elaborate further.
	“If you have our payment ready.”  Thallan answered, staring down the smaller man with his deep brown eyes.
	“You have very nice eyes.”  Therin said nervously, as he rubbed at whatever it was that he held in his hands.   “Do you know how rare it is for an elf to have brown eyes?”
	“Thank you.  And yes, indeed I do.”  Thallan replied flashing him a smile and brushing a lock of his dark teal hair out of his face.  “Flattery won’t make me go away you know.  Now how about the payment.”
	“Oh yes, the payment.  The payment you came to collect.  The reason you’re here and the reason you come every month on the same day.  The payment that ensures my businesses safety from criminals.”  Therin said very quickly.  “That payment?”
	“No, I was talking about a completely different payment.”  Thallan said sarcastically, rolling his eyes.  “Of course, I meant that payment.
	“Why does it always have to be business with you?  I just got some new product in I think you would find it intriguing.  Let me show you.”  Therin said, hoping off his stool and walking around the counter, and over towards the shelves before Thallan could object.
	“Therin.”  Thallan called.
	“Just a minute.”  Came the reply.  “It’s around here somewhere!”
	Sighing, Thallan reached over the desk and plucked up the cleaning cloth Therin had discarded while unsheathing his knife from the back of his belt with his other hand.  It was still slightly dirty from when he had used it last.  What had that been for?  He wondered as he wiped the blade clean.  
	“Here it is!”  Therin announced, reemerging from the shelves holding a blue and orange package in his hand.  “It’s used for—”
	“Ham sandwich extra mustard!”  Thallan exclaimed, suddenly remembering why his knife was so dirty.
	“Well, no.  Not exactly.”  Therin said, slightly confused.  “It’s used for interrupting crystalic rays so that you can work on something without cutting the power.”
	“Not that you nincompoop.”  Thallan retorted, pointing the blade towards the halfling, who went pale at the sight of the knife.  Sighing, Thallan motioned with two fingers for him to closer as he squatted down to his height.  “Therin, as you well know I am not a mechanic, I work for the Pearl, and we both know you’re stalling.   You don’t have the payment, do you?”  He asked, staring hard into the little man’s eyes. 
	“Times have been hard recently, you know that!  Not as many customers.  People are getting everything through that stupid online delivery service.”  Therin wailed, throwing his hands up.
	“That’s no excuse.”  Thallan said, rising back to his full height to tower over the small man.  “Times are hard for everyone, but the others paid their full protection on time.  Now, how much do you have?”  
	Therin looked down at his ruddy brown shoes.  “Half.”  He mumbled.
	“Half?”  Thallan repeated incredulously, letting out a short bark of laughter.  “What have you been doing with all our money Therin?”
	“I just need a little more time.”  The halfling pleaded.  
	“No payment.  No protection.”  Thallan stated calmly, sheathing his knife at the back of his belt.  “You know that.”
	“But what about the street gangs that are popping up everywhere?”  Therin cried, as Thallan turned to walk back to the door.  “If news gets out, I don’t have protection, I’ll be ruined!”
	“Well, you should have thought of that before spending all our money on a beam mirror thing.”  Thallan said, raising his hands as he started slowly walking back to the door.
	“Skinny Johnny was right.  The Pearls are losing their touch.”  Therin said his voice suddenly calm, his words freezing Therin to the spot.
	“What did you say?”  Thallan demanded, spinning on his heels to stare down the halfling.
	“I said The Pearl is losing her touch.”  Therin repeated, enunciating every word insultingly slow.
	Thallan crossed the short distance between them in three quick strides.  Grabbing the smaller man by the collar he lifted him off the ground.  “What’s that supposed to mean?”  He growled quietly.
	“It means, this is Rose territory now.”  A nasal voice called from across the room.
	Muttering a curse under his breath, Thallan turned to see two very large men and a third slightly smaller man walking out from the behind the black cloth that led to the backroom.  The first one, the smaller one who had spoken, was none other then Skinny Johnny himself, who looked like he had had his fair share of ham sandwiches with extra everything.
