                    <h2>Intro</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I’m Garrett Peterson, a fantasy author who loves telling stories of good versus evil, rich new worlds, and deeply human characters readers can connect with.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by my favorite fantasy series and shaped by my Christian faith, I strive to write and publish clean fantasy stories that are both compelling and uplifting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="promise">
                    <p>I primarily write fantasy and urban fantasy, though I also enjoy exploring science fiction and other forms of speculative fiction.</p>
                    <p>My work blends epic scope with grounded, emotional characters, focusing on the moments when ordinary people collide with the extraordinary.</p>
                    <p>Recurring themes in my stories include redemption, unlikely heroes, hope in darkness, and the ongoing struggle between light and dark.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mission">
                    <p>My purpose as a writer is to share imaginative, uplifting stories that inspire and bring joy. Influenced by my favorite authors and guided by my lifelong Christian faith, I aim to create high-quality, clean fantasy that is both fun and exciting to read. Through rich worlds, meaningful characters, and themes of hope, courage, and perseverance, my goal is to offer stories that inspire as much as they entertain.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="details">
                    <p>When I’m not reading or writing fantasy, I enjoy playing guitar, building things with my hands, gaming in all its forms, and spending time with my lovely wife.</p>
                    <p>Some of my favorite book series include <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> by J.R.R. Tolkien, <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> by Brandon Sanderson, and <em>Lockwood &amp; Co.</em> by Jonathan Stroud. You may notice inspiration from these and other works woven into my own stories.</p>
